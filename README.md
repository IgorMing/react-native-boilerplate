# React Native Boilerplate

Boilerplate created with Facebook's boilerplate generator [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) _(more instructions related with the boilerplate creation can be found on their huge [documentation](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#create-react-native-app))_

Reasons for create my own boilerplate
-
We have an awesome boilerplate creator from Facebook, as I wrote above, but we still have lots of other necessities when we are developing an application from scratch. But, coincidentally/fortunately, the first requirements are almost equal. (decent eslint configuration, authentication, clean navigation, even internationalization sometimes, etc).

Looking for it, I considered important create my own boilerplate, **for my own projects**. But, of course, I put everything open source, because this is a good propose, which pragmatic developers will probably consider very important to look at.

Why not use existing boilerplate creators?
-
We have tons of boilerplates, when we look at [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/generators/), for example. And we have the repository [Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) as the best one, absolutelly.

So, looking for the question: "Why not use ignite's boilerplate?"

The answer is pretty simple. It provides me lots of unuseful code. The implementation of [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) (I'm used to use [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)), and a massive configuration that I would not like to use.

### I can cite the reasons below:

* I like to do my boilerplates from zero, because I know how to handle every single line of code.
* I can learn a LOT doing that, and I never will ask for myself: "What the f#%k is going on here?"** _(I hope so)_
* It is going to save my time in the future, for new projects created from scratch.
* And of course, the most important one. Because I want :)

So, lets stop wasting time reading this bunch of useless stuff.
